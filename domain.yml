  - text: " Salam, this is Sunny üåû an intelligent chatbot powered by SolarAi ‚ö°\n
I can help you find out how much you can save on your electricity bills üíµ while helping out our planet üåè\n
I will also help answer general queries relating to offsetting expensive & unstable grid energy üí• with cheaper planet-friendly solar energy üôã‚Äç‚ôÇ\n"

  utter_benefits:
  - text: "‚ÄúSolar power is the last energy resource that isn't owned yet - nobody taxes the sun yet.‚Äù üåû\n
World typically produces around 51 billion tons of Carbon Emissions every year, and the power sector alone contributes to about a quarter of these emissions. üí®\n
There is no path to deep decarbonization without involving the clean power sector, and there is no path to clean power without deploying significant Solar energy.‚ùó\n
With the increase in energy demands and grid rates, solar may be the best option for both your home and business.\n
You may select any of the following options to know more about solar energy! üëá"

  utter_financial_benefits:
  - text: "When you install a solar energy system on your property, you save money on your electricity bills instantly üí∏ and protect yourself against rising electricity rates in the future. üò± \n
How much you can save depends on the utility rates and type of Solar PV system, but going solar is a smart investment regardless of where you live. \n
Typical payback period for home users is around 3 years for net-metering solar systems. And typical levelized cost of energy for Commercial & Industrial Solar PV plants is under PKR 3 over the lifetime of PV Plant. üí°\n "

  utter_net_metering:
  - text: "Net metering is the system that electricity distribution companies use to credit solar energy system owners for the electricity produced by their solar panels. With net metering, you can sell the extra electricity produced by your solar unit to the grid. You can offset expensive electricity bills and attain energy independence via Solar-led net-metering. \n
For more information, please visit our website (website)"

  utter_environmental_benefits:
  - text: "Solar power, like other renewable energy resources, has many environmental and health benefits. Going solar reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change, and also results in fewer air pollutants like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, which can cause health problems. World at large typically emits 51 billion tons of GHGs in the year, and more than one fifth of this carbon footprint has a lifetime of over 10,000 years. \n
Typically, a 10-kW residential Solar Solution can offset roughly 13.5 tons of carbon footprint per year. Meanwhile, Pakistan‚Äôs carbon emissions are roughly 1.5 tons per capital. üí° . "

  utter_working:
  - text: "Solar panels absorb the sun's energy throughout the day and convert it into direct current (DC) electricity. Most homes and businesses run on alternating current (AC) electricity, so the DC electricity is then passed through an inverter to convert it to usable AC electricity. At that point, you either use the electricity in your house or send it back to the electric grid for net-metering."
  
  utter_sunshine:
  - text: "The amount of power your solar energy system can generate is dependent on sunlight. As a result, your solar panels will produce slightly less energy when the weather is cloudy, and no energy at night. However, because of high electricity costs and financial incentives, solar is a smart decision even if you live in a cloudy city. Typically, in Pakistan, you get an average of about 4.7 hours of sunlight, this varies from city to city meanwhile.\n
You can also add battery backup in the system design to conserve energy while the sun is shining and consume stored energy during the night / on-peak times."

  utter_dust:
  - text: "Solar panels convert sunshine into power, so if your panels are covered in dust, they can‚Äôt produce electricity effectively. Dust generally isn‚Äôt heavy enough to cause structural issues with your panels, and your panels can be cleaned by watering or using cleaning systems for PV. If dust does accumulate, your panels are easy to clean.\n
Also, by opting for a Power Optimizer based system design, you can offset the impact of soiling losses or dust losses to solar generated energy while future-proofing your PV System.\n
You can learn more about intelligence-driven power optimizer-based inverters at [Web link]"

  utter_offgrid:
  - text: "When you install solar panels on your property, you will still be connected to the grid. This allows you to draw from the grid when your system is not producing all of the power that you need, and send power back to the grid when you produce more than you use. It is possible to go off the grid with a solar energy system that includes battery storage, but it will cost significantly more and is usually not required for the majority of grid-connected homeowners.\n
Meanwhile for Captive Power Factories, adding Solar Plants in the power mix can significantly bring down your levelized cost of energy while offsetting your carbon footprint."

  utter_solar_bill:
  - text: "Unless your solar energy system includes battery storage and you are fully off the grid, you will still receive a bill from your utility. However, you can dramatically reduce your bill with a solar panel system that matches your energy use."

  utter_blackout:
  - text: "If your solar panel system is connected to the grid, it will shut off in the event of a blackout. This is to prevent emergency responders and electricity utility repair-people from being injured by your panels sending power back to the grid. However, there are certain inverters you can buy that provide backup power in a blackout when paired with an Energy Storage System."

  utter_maintainance_cost:
  - text: "Solar panel systems are made of durable tempered glass and require little to no maintenance for the 25 to 30 years. In most cases, you don‚Äôt even need to clean your solar panels regularly. If something does happen, most equipment manufacturers include warranties, although warranty terms depend on the OEM."

  utter_finance:
  - text: "Solar Ai has partnered with multiple banks, including JS Bank, for expedited application approval for Solar financing. If you are a business owner and interested in Power Purchase Agreement, there are options available to get a discount on your existing expensive electricity bills without investing upfront costs of the Solar Plant.\n
You may want to reach out to our business analysts at [link to set up appointment form] to discuss further your financing options."

  utter_lease:
  - text: "If you buy your Solar System, you are able to maximize your financial savings immediately. Meanwhile, leasing your PV System might be more prudent if your cost of capital is high and cost of debt is low. Depending upon the situation unique to your circumstance, benefits of either self-financing or bank financing can be weighed to arrive at a better-informed decision.\n
Our expert team at Solar Ai can help curate a Solarization package for you and you can book your consultation session at [link to calendar invite]"

  utter_EPC_PPA:
  - text: "For Commercial & Industrial purposes, users can opt for either EPC or PPA options. In the former, an EPC firm such as Solar Ai, is hired to design a custom engineered solution unique to the business. Site surveys, existing power mix analysis, PV System Simulations, financial modeling and levelized cost of energy savings are prepared for the client along with suggestions on optimal equipment selection. A C&I user, after careful evaluation of the proposals by EPC and/or Solar consultants, awards a self-funded or bank-funded EPC contract.\n
However, in Power Purchase Agreement [PPA], an entity undertakes all the work of the EPC, but negotiates an energy tariff with C&I users, typically between 15 and 25 years, to deploy Solar PV Plant. Capital for the plant is arranged by the entity signing the PPA with C&I user."

  utter_solar_cost:
  - text: "If you can afford to pay your electricity bill you can afford to go solar. Subsidized bank loans at or under 6% for Solar Home or Business financing makes the proposition even more compelling.\n
Furthermore, Commercial and Industrial entities might also be able to get Carbon Emissions Reduction Credits that can be traded at international markets for additional financial benefits."

  utter_roof_size:
  - text: "Southerly-facing roofs with little to no shade and enough space to fit a solar panel system are ideal for installing traditional solar systems. However, in many cases there are workarounds if your home doesn‚Äôt have the ideal solar roof.\n
We at Solar Ai, have introduced Power Optimizers based inverters, to specifically address the shading issue as well as transforming each Solar module into an intelligent unit optimized for harnessing maximum energy.\n
Follow the easy stepwise guide on our website www.solarai.energy to learn more about all of your options."

  utter_solar_size:
  - text: "The size of your solar energy system will depend on how much electricity you use on a monthly basis, as well as the weather conditions where you live. Take a look at our website and follow the ‚ÄúGet a quotation‚Äù journey to get a customized solution catering to all your electricity needs."

  utter_roof_replace:
  - text: "Solar energy systems can last for 25 to 30 years, and it can be costly to remove and reinstall them if you need to replace your roof. If your roof needs maintenance in the near term, you should complete it before you finish your solar installation. Our technical personnel at Solar Ai will be able to tell you whether to replace your roof before going solar.\n
Get in touch with our team at (Number) or website."

  utter_expiry_date:
  - text: "In general, solar panels are very durable and capable of withstanding snow, wind, and hail. The various components of your solar power system, such as inverters, will need to be replaced at different times, but your system should continue to generate electricity for 25 to 30 years.\n
Our special offering includes an industry leading 12-year Standard Warranty for Power-Optimizer based inverters, an award-winning German technology. You can find out more about our offers at www.solarai.energy"

2.	Bifacial (Mono PERC Half Cut): Module Efficiency +21% with up to 25% gain from the bifacial (from the rear side of the module)\n  
3.	All Black (Mono PERC): (Mono PERC Half Cut): Module Efficiency +21% (For immaculate aesthetics of your home facade)"

  utter_inverter_types:
  - text: "We offer two types of Solar Inverters:\n
1.	Traditional Inverter:\n
\t\tThese are the most commonly used inverters in conventional PV Systems. They are based on legacy technology which starts off with maximum energy production but gradually the output energy decays over the span of years. So the efficiency of the system gradually reduces after the first year of usage, and keeps on reducing at a slow pace.\n
2.	Solar-Edge Inverter:\n
\t\tThese are based on leading German technology used in advanced PV systems. This technology enables the PV system to maintain its maximum efficiency even after years of usage. The optimizer-based technology used in Solar-Edge Inverters produces more energy as compared to Traditional Inverters and hence is more efficient over the span of years."

  utter_batteries:
  - text: "Solar power systems that include solar batteries, known as solar-plus-storage, are increasingly popular, but can be pricey. However, with the current situation of the grid system in Pakistan, it may be a good option to opt for solar batteries with your solar power system for homes, as it will help in providing electricity during load-shedding and you also will have the option to draw electricity from batteries during peak hours to further reduce your electricity bill. \n
Growingly, large-scale Energy Storage Systems (ESS) of 1 MW and above rated storage capacities are also being deployed by Commercial & Industrial users in the South Asian region. Such large scale ESS solutions are able to harness solar energy from PV Plant and are able to address intermittency bottlenecks of integrating Solar in existing power mix.  "
